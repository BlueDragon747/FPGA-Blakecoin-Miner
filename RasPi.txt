Blakeminer Installation Guide For Raspberry Pi
==============================================

NOTE This is an early draft, the instructions have not been yet tested on a fresh
installation, so there may be some issues. Feedback is welcome.

This guide documents my original installation on a Debian Wheezy distribution (2012
vintage), specifically ...
3.2.27+ #250 PREEMPT Thu Oct 18 19:03:02 BST 2012 armv6l GNU/Linux
This is quite an old version so there may be some differences. The current distro
is available from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads which I expect will be the
best one to use for a fresh install (I have not tested this).

For ease of use, I would recommend installation of ssh and ftp servers. On my distro
ssh is enabled via the initial boot option screen. This can be rerun via:
sudo raspi-config

Then install ftp:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ftp ftpd

Installation of Blake Wallet (optional)
=======================================
NB Only the command line daemon is covered. I have not tried the QT wallet.

Install the dependancies ...
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
     libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev \
     libssl-dev libdb5.1++-dev libminiupnpc-dev

NB We are using libdb5.1 here rather than the recommended libdb4.8 as this is not
available for the raspi. The wallet.dat will NOT be compatible with the windows
client so you won't be able to transfer wallet backups.

Download the blake wallet source from https://github.com/BlueDragon747/Blakecoin
This is Blakecoin-master.zip. Move it to your home directory and unzip it ...
unzip Blakecoin-master.zip

Now compile as follows ...
cd Blakecoin-master/src
make -f makefile.unix

This will take a couple of hours and will report some warnings. If it completes
sucessfully you should have a file blakecoind created as the most recent file.
ls -ltr

Strip the symbol information
strip blakecoind

Now create the daemon folder and move the file
mkdir ~/.blakecoin
mv blakecoind ~/.blakecoin
cd ~/.blakecoin

Create the configuration file using a text editor (nano is easiest to use)
nano blakecoin.conf

A typical configuration is as follows ...
listen=1
gen=0
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=192.168.1.*
rpcuser=secretusername
rpcpassword=secretpassword
rpcport=8772
server=1
daemon=1
addnode=162.243.133.80
addnode=162.243.14.130
addnode=146.185.135.24

NB choose your own secretusername/secretpassword (anything will do here)
Save the file and exit, then start the daemon
./blakecoind

It will now create the wallet and download the blockchain. You can check the
progress via:
./blakecoind getinfo

Messages are logged to debug.log
tail debug.log

To shut down the daemon (eg before a system shutdown)
./blakecoind stop

Building the cgminer
====================
Install the dependancies ...
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential  libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-1.0-0 libcurl4-openssl-dev \
     libncurses5-dev libudev-dev

Download the official cgminer 3.1.1 from https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/archive/v3.1.1.zip
unzip cgminer-3.1.1.zip

Download my patches from https://github.com/kramble/FPGA-Blakecoin-Miner/archive/master.zip
unzip FPGA-Blakecoin-Miner-master.zip

Now copy my patches over the original
cd FPGA-Blakecoin-Miner-master/cgminer/cgminer-3.1.1
cp * ~/cgminer-3.1.1

Configure and build
cd ~/cgminer-3.1.1
./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --enable-icarus --enable-ztex
make

This will take a while and will report some warnings. If it completes sucessfully you should
have a file cgminer created as the most recent file.
ls -ltr

Strip the symbol information
strip cgminer

You can run the miner from the compilation directory, but it's more convenient to move it.
mkdir ~/blakeminer
mv cgminer ~/blakeminer
cd ~/blakeminer

USB Driver installation is not required, but some configuration may be neccessary.
Specifically for Enterpoint CM1 you will need to add the following line to /etc/modules
ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0x8350

With ztex devices you will need to run cgminer as sudo to avoid permissions errors on the
USB devices (this is fixable by a change to /etc/udev/rules.d but I never bothered).
BEWARE, this is a security risk.

Some examples (you should create scripts for these commands)

Basic usage for ztex devices, mining solo
sudo ./cgminer --url localhost:8772 --userpass secretusername:secretpassword 2>log.txt

CM1, mining solo
./cgminer -S /dev/ttyUSB0 -S /dev/ttyUSB1 -S /dev/ttyUSB2 -S /dev/ttyUSB3 --url localhost:8772 --userpass secretusername:secretpassword 2>log.txt

For background mining, create a script mine.sh containing the cgminer command
eg this is my lancelot script for pool mining with solo failover

./cgminer -T --verbose --cainsmore-clock 195 --icarus-timing 1.0=20 -S /dev/ttyUSB0 --url stratum+tcp://eu1.blakecoin.com:3334 --userpass username.worker:password --failover-only --url localhost:8772 --userpass secretusername:secretpassword 2>log.txt

Then run it as follows ...
nohup mine.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &

To stop it, you will need to identify the process and kill it. If started sudo it
will run under the root user, so list the processes to find the PID for cgminer.
ps -ef
sudo kill PID (enter the pid number instead of PID)

I find the Raspberry Pi can be a little unreliable (the network stack locks up on
mine from time to time), so you may want to implement a watchdog and automatic reboot.
I'll publish my scripts for this at a future date.
